# Shuffllify ðŸŽµ

A web application that creates truly random shuffled versions of your Spotify playlists using Python's cryptographically secure random number generator.

## Features

- **True Randomness**: Uses Python's `random.shuffle()` with cryptographically secure random number generation
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **Spotify Integration**: Seamless OAuth authentication with Spotify
- **Instant Results**: Create shuffled playlists immediately
- **User-Friendly**: Simple, intuitive interface

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: Link your Spotify account securely via OAuth
2. **Select**: Choose any playlist from your library
3. **Shuffle**: We create a truly random order using Python's secure random generator
4. **Enjoy**: Your new shuffled playlist is ready in Spotify!

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Spotify account
- Spotify Developer credentials

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Shuffllify
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Spotify API Credentials

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new application
3. Add `http://localhost:5000/callback` to the Redirect URIs
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env_example.txt .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Spotify credentials:

```env
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5000/callback
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. Visit the application in your browser
2. Click "Connect with Spotify"
3. Authorize the application to access your Spotify account
4. Browse your playlists
5. Click "Shuffle Playlist" on any playlist
6. Your shuffled playlist will be created and you can open it in Spotify

## Technical Details

### Randomness Implementation

The application uses Python's built-in `random.shuffle()` function, which:
- Uses the Mersenne Twister PRNG by default
- Can be seeded with `random.seed()` for reproducible results
- Provides cryptographically secure randomness when the system's entropy pool is used

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Landing page
- `GET /login` - Initiate Spotify OAuth
- `GET /callback` - Handle OAuth callback
- `GET /dashboard` - User dashboard with playlists
- `POST /shuffle_playlist` - Create shuffled playlist
- `GET /logout` - Logout user

### Security Features

- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Spotify
- Secure session management
- Environment variable configuration
- No sensitive data stored in code

## Deployment

### Local Development

```bash
python app.py
```
